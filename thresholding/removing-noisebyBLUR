# First import OpenCV, NumPY and MatPlotLib as we will use these libraries
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load a color image

# Apply some blurring to reduce noise

# h is the Parameter regulating filter strength for luminance component. 
# Bigger h value perfectly removes noise but also removes image details, 
# smaller h value preserves details but also preserves some noise

# Hint: I recommend using larger h and hColor values than typical to remove noise at the
# expense of losing image details

# Experiment with setting h and hColor to a suitable value.

# Exercise: Insert code here to set values for h and hColor. 
h = 20
hColor = 10
# Hint: You'll find answers at the bottom of the lab.
